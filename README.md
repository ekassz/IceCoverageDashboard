## This Project focused on Service Learning on Ice Safety
## The goal was to recreate the current visual: https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/ice/#historical

## We redesigned the current static visual to an interactive dashboard: https://ekass.shinyapps.io/IceCoverage/
### The Re-Design focuses on the following:
#### Less Chart Junk
- Has interactive drop-down input to switch from different lakes.
- Has on/off option to view the red dashed average line at your own pace.
- Has slider input to select the range of year/s you want to explore.
#### Simplicity
- The entire graphical display follows symmetrical lines and a simplified expression of data that is able to fully express all the necessary data while not showing anything unnecessary.
